      <p>Selecting the right roofing contractor is one of the most important decisions you'll make as a homeowner. Your roof protects everything you value, so you need a contractor you can trust.</p>

      <h2>Essential Questions to Ask</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Are you licensed and insured in North Carolina?</strong> – Verify they carry both liability insurance and workers' compensation.</li>
        <li><strong>Do you offer written estimates?</strong> – Always get detailed, written quotes before signing any contract.</li>
        <li><strong>What warranties do you offer?</strong> – Look for both material warranties (from manufacturers) and workmanship guarantees.</li>
        <li><strong>Can you provide local references?</strong> – Reputable contractors will gladly share contact information for recent clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Will you obtain the necessary permits?</strong> – Professional contractors handle all required building permits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contractors who demand full payment upfront</li>
        <li>No physical business address or local presence</li>
        <li>Unusually low bids that seem too good to be true</li>
        <li>No written contract or estimate</li>
        <li>Pressure tactics to decide immediately</li>
      </ul>
