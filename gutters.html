  <h2>Why Gutters Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Gutters are one of the most important protective systems in any home. By directing rainwater away from your roof, siding, and foundation, gutters prevent costly damage such as basement flooding, soil erosion, and weakened structural integrity. Without a reliable gutter system, water can accumulate around your property and create long-term problems.
  </p>
